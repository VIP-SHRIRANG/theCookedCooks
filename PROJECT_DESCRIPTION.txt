ChainGuard - Real-Time DeFi Fraud Detection System

ChainGuard is a production-ready blockchain fraud detection system that monitors Polygon Mainnet transactions in real-time using advanced machine learning. The system combines a Python Flask API backend with a professional React dashboard to provide instant fraud analysis and risk scoring.

Key Features:
• Real-time blockchain monitoring via WebSocket connection to Polygon Mainnet
• Advanced ML pipeline using CatBoost classifier with 94% ROC-AUC performance
• Professional React dashboard with live charts, threat mapping, and node analysis
• Risk scoring system (0-100) with configurable thresholds: Approved (<65%), Suspicious (65-79%), Blocked (≥80%)
• Batch CSV analysis for processing large transaction datasets
• SQLite database integration for transaction history and analytics
• Node analysis for identifying fraud patterns and suspicious wallet clusters

Technical Architecture:
• Backend: Python Flask API with Web3.py for blockchain connectivity
• Frontend: React.js with Material-UI components and Recharts for visualization
• ML Engine: CatBoost classifier with 15 engineered features including behavioral patterns, temporal analysis, and fraud indicators
• Database: SQLite for persistent storage and analytics
• Real-time Processing: Sub-second inference on live transactions with WebSocket streaming

The system is designed for enterprise deployment with comprehensive documentation, multiple launcher options, model retraining capabilities, and production-ready error handling. ChainGuard provides DeFi platforms with the tools needed to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions before they impact users.
